          Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Oktay and I'm from Berlin, Germany. As a
          Full-Stack software developer, I specialize in creating visually
          appealing websites, apps and mobile games. My passion for graphic
          design isn't just a hobby, it's a key ingredient in every project I
          work{" "}
          <span className={`${open ? "block" : "hidden"}`}>
            {" "}
            Growing up bilingual, I developed a love for languages and I
            currently speak four of them fluently. I believe that this skill has
            given me a unique perspective and allows me to communicate
            effectively with clients from all over the world. One of my
            strengths is adding a personal touch to my projects by adding the
            client's identity and message into the design, creating meaningful
            and beautiful end products that are both eye-catching and
            user-friendly. In my free time, I enjoy exploring my other passions,
            such as photography and music production, which provide me with
            creative outlets. I am also very passionate about Web3 and
            everything related to crypto, NFTs and blockchain technology as I
            believe they have the potential to revolutionize business and online
            interactions. If you have an innovative idea for a project that
            needs to be developed, I would love to hear from you. Your vision
            can be turned into a real product. Don't hesitate to reach out and
            let's start a conversation about your concept. I'm excited to
            collaborate and help bring your ideas to life.
